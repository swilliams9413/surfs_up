# Overview
To gather and summarize temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

# Results
- June and December seem to not have as huge a swing in temperature as the continental United States.
- It should be warm enough during both months to attract customers since the mean temperate for June and December are 75 and 71 degrees respectively.
- The small variance in temperature over the two months suggest Oahu would be a great place for an ice cream shop.

# Summary
Through the use of summary statistics we have determined that an ice cream shop in Oahu could be profitable year-round. However, further investigation into the temperatures of the other 10 months would be necessary to get a full picture, and reaffirm assumptions
